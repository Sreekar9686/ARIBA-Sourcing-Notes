Contract Workspace:
This is an SAP ARIBA cloud solution which includes all document,task,team, main agrement which all these are inherited from template which we select while creating an workspace.
They are 3 types of contract workspace.
Contract Workspace(pROCUREMENT)
This is widely used by many organizations. This is widely done by Supplier & Buyer.
Contract(Sales):
This is similar to forward auction insourcing. This is used in manufacturing sector. Where you sell youtr scrap material to supplier.
Contract(Internal)
This isused within organixation for different purposes.

Coming to templates:
We can create templates based on our needs similar to sourcing.
We can put conditions on templates when this template should be shown. Like based on commodity,region,department. value.

3 ways to create a contract workspace.

1) You can create contract workspace directly.
2) You can copy from existing contract Workspace.
3) You can initiate contract request

Creating an workspace directly after Sourcing event after awarding supplier will expedite the process.
Because you already have suppliers, required information in event itself.
All these information is copied to contract.
After awarding the supplier, you will be populated with 2 field. Create a new contract, Add to existing contract. Based on the  option available you can select.


Workspace documents:

These are inherited from the template which we have selected. Also tasks are inherited.
Documents are associated with tasks.

We have following documents types:
Assembled documents : These are associated with SAP ARIBA contracts only. These documents must be MS word
Contract line item documents: This indicates price, quantity of the contract.
This is created in 2 ways:
At project creation time, user selects contract workspace and selects template this will create an empty line item documents:
After completion of sourcing event if they click on contract, whichever items are available in sourcing these are added as CLID.
Internal documents
Reference document

tasks in contract workspace:
Tasks can be created in phases. Which can be seen in organized way of performing tasks.

Team
You can create an project group who can access, review, negotiate few tasks.
We can setup conditions as well at this level.

Authoring Phase: This phases includes Editing main agreement, Modifying clauses or sections.

This phase is core part of contracts includes main agreement of the workspace.
SAP ARIBA Provides ECA which is new drap & drop option easily move documents integrated with Microsoft word to edit all changes in agreement.
Contracting authoring will enable you todo changes in main agreement. Under main agreement we can have multiple sub-agreement. But both should be using same version of word document.
Main clauses & sections should be there in main agreement. And supporting documents can be present in sub-agreement.
Assembled documents have 2 views
Outline view: This use to change the document structure.
Microsoft review: Add/delete/move/modify in section or clause.
Outline view displays type of 
Template clause: These are inherited while creating the template
Non-standard: This is used you are editing any standard template then it is considered as this clause
Adhoc library:is type indicates a clause that was added to the workspace directly from the Clause Library as an additional clause or substitution for an existing clause.
Adhoc:his type indicates a clause that was uploaded from a Microsoft Word document or added directly to the contract document in Microsoft Word
